How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    of course that was good.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Can see what did I update pretty quickly.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    No pros of manual method over automatic so far.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git can be complex at time but well what do I know I'm just learning.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log will help me in seeing all the differences I've made with comments
    and git diff will show all the changes I've made.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because I can get back to any older version easily and check the difference
    between two versions.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    For writing codes in nanodegree projects.
